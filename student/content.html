        Hi! I am Alex Nussbaumer (WLM9W8) and this is my solution for the Web Technologies home assignment.
        In this assignment I had to create the front-end for an already existing back-end using HTML, CSS and JS.
        The topic of the assignment is an online car database, that can store cars and car manufacturers.
    </p>
    <div id="buttonDiv">
        <button id="show" onclick="Show(this.id)" title="Click to show more info!">Show assignment description</button>
    </div>

    <div id="description">
        <div class="header">Assignment description</div>
        <p>For the assignment you have to write the front-end for the given back-end by using the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript with jQuery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following methods with these URLs have to be implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>manufacturers: Returns a json containing every manufacturer in the "database".</li>
            <li>manufacturerNames: Returns the names of the manufacturers. Should be used in forms.</li>
            <li>cars: Returns a json containing every car in the "database".</li>
            <li>manufacturer: Returns the cars that belong to that manufacturer stored in cookies.</li>
            <li>addCar: Adds a new car to the "database". If there is an already existing car with this name in the database
                , it returns a 409 http error code.</li>
            <li>addManufacturer: Same as addCar, but with manufacturer.</li>
            <li>/: returns index.html stored in the student folder which you have to create.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Usage of CSS, other JS libraries, frameworks results in failure. Lack of CSS and jQuery results in failure.
            Fundamental tempering with the server results in failure. Change of port or host is allowed if necessary,
            but the webpage should run on any computer.
            If you can not prove that you wrote the front-end (can't change basic details, explain something) you will fail.
            Lack of features will result in failure. etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The offered grade for the course will be given based on the quality of the code, the webpage,
            and your level of understanding.
            The assignments can be written during the practice classes after we learned about AJAX.
            Absence will be noted in the attendance!
            The assignment can be evaluated after the middle of November. Adam Satan will evaluate it and give your offered
            grade.
