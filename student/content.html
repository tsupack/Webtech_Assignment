<p>For the assignment you have to write the frontend for it using the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript with jQuery</li>
</ul>
<p>
Usage of css or other js libraries, frameworks result in failure. Lack of css and jQuery result in failure.
Fundamental tempering with the server will result in failure. Change of port or host is allowed if necessary,
but the webpage should run on any computer.
If you can not prove that you wrote the frontend (can not change basic details, explain something) you will fail.
Lack of features will result in failure. etc.
</p>
<p>
The offered grade for the course will be given based on the quality of the code, the webpage,
    and your level of understanding.
The assignments can be written during the practice classes after we learned about AJAX.
    Absence will be noted in the attendance!
The assignment can be evaluated after the middle of november. I, Adam Satan will evaluate it and give your offered grade.

<p>The following methods can be found in the server with these urls:</p>
<ul>
